## Bitcoin Mining Sees Sharpest Difficulty Drop Since 2021 China Ban

Bitcoin's mining difficulty [dropped 11.3%](https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-difficulty-drops-11-worst-2021-china-ban) this week, the largest decline since China's 2021 mining crackdown. The adjustment reflects hash rate volatility as miners exit during price weakness below $70K. Last time we saw drops this steep, China banned mining operations entirely—this time it's pure market dynamics forcing capitulation among leveraged operations.

## Three Theories Behind Bitcoin's Trip Below $60K

Cointelegraph [examines competing theories](https://cointelegraph.com/news/what-crashed-bitcoin-three-theories-btc-trip-below-60k) for BTC's recent sell-off: Hong Kong hedge funds unwinding leveraged positions, macro correlation with equities, and institutional profit-taking after ETF inflows stalled. The Hong Kong thesis is gaining traction—leveraged funds betting on range-bound trading got liquidated when volatility spiked. Classic case of too much leverage chasing too little edge.

## Shannon: Autonomous AI Hacker Achieves 96% Success Rate

KeygraphHQ released [Shannon](https://github.com/KeygraphHQ/shannon), an autonomous AI agent that finds exploits in web apps without hints or source access. 96.15% success rate on the XBOW benchmark. Built in TypeScript, it's already trending #1 on GitHub with 3,100+ stars in 24 hours. The "AI red team" space is heating up—automated vulnerability discovery at scale changes the economics of security testing entirely.

## LocalGPT: Local-First AI Assistant in Rust

[LocalGPT](https://github.com/localgpt-app/localgpt) brings persistent memory and local-first design to AI assistants, written in Rust. No cloud dependencies, your data stays on your machine. 220 points on HN with solid discussion about tradeoffs vs. hosted solutions. For privacy-conscious developers building on LLMs, this is the starting point you've been looking for.

## Microsoft's Litebox: Security-Focused Library OS in Rust

Microsoft open-sourced [Litebox](https://github.com/microsoft/litebox), a security-focused library OS supporting both kernel and user-mode execution. Written in Rust, it's designed for sandboxed workloads with minimal attack surface. 584 stars today—Microsoft's continued bet on Rust for systems programming validates what the community has known for years. The future of OS security is memory-safe languages at every layer.

## LLMs as Language Compilers: Lessons from Fortran

This [blog post](https://cyber-omelette.com/posts/the-abstraction-rises.html) draws parallels between LLMs and Fortran's role as an abstraction layer over assembly. Fortran didn't replace programmers—it let them work at a higher level. LLMs do the same: they raise the abstraction floor, not the ceiling. The programmers who learn to think in prompts the way previous generations thought in Fortran will dominate the next decade of software development.

## Beyond Agentic Coding: A Haskell Perspective

Gabriel Gonzalez (Haskell for All) [argues](https://haskellforall.com/2026/02/beyond-agentic-coding) that agentic AI coding tools are over-hyped for complex systems work. Type systems, formal verification, and compiler-enforced correctness still beat "agent iterates until tests pass." His point: agents are good at glue code, terrible at architecture. Don't mistake velocity for quality—fast buggy code is still buggy code.

## Trivy: Multi-Cloud Vulnerability Scanner Trending

Aqua Security's [Trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy) is trending with 168 stars today. Scans containers, Kubernetes, code repos, and cloud configs for vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, secrets, and SBOM issues. Written in Go, 31K+ stars total. The shift from "scan your containers" to "scan everything" is real—security tools need to match the complexity of modern deployment stacks.

## Claude Fast Mode: Speed Up Responses

Anthropic launched [Fast Mode](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/fast-mode) for Claude Code, trading some reasoning depth for faster iteration cycles. HN discussion (191 comments) splits between "this is great for refactoring" and "defeats the point of extended thinking." The meta-lesson: latency matters more than people admit. Even power users will sacrifice accuracy for speed when the feedback loop tightens.

## Substack Data Breach: Email Addresses and Phone Numbers Exposed

Substack confirmed a [data breach](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/05/substack-confirms-data-breach-affecting-email-addresses-and-phone-numbers/) exposing user emails and phone numbers. No passwords or payment info compromised. Classic mistake: treating contact info as non-sensitive. In 2026, email addresses are authentication factors and phone numbers are 2FA vectors—losing them is losing the keys to your users' digital identities.

## OpenCiv3: Open-Source Civilization III Reimagining

[OpenCiv3](https://openciv3.org/) hit #1 on HN with 921 points—a cross-platform, open-source reimplementation of Civilization III. The project proves there's still massive appetite for classic game engines rebuilt with modern tooling. Nostalgia + open source + actual working code is a winning combo.

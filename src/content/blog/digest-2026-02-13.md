## Tambo Goes Generative

[tambo-ai/tambo](https://github.com/tambo-ai/tambo) hit 9.3k stars with a TypeScript SDK for building generative UI in React. It's getting 300 stars/day, which means people are shipping with it. Worth checking if you're building anything that renders dynamic interfaces from model outputs.

## Google Ships LangExtract

[google/langextract](https://github.com/google/langextract) is Python tooling for pulling structured data from unstructured text using LLMs. 31k stars suggests this solves a real problem. The source grounding and visualization features look useful for debugging extraction pipelines.

## Personal AI Infrastructure Pattern Emerges

Daniel Miessler's [Personal_AI_Infrastructure](https://github.com/danielmiessler/Personal_AI_Infrastructure) repo (7.8k stars, 351 today) documents agentic AI setups for personal use. It's not a framework—it's documented patterns for wiring up your own system. Good reference if you're building something similar.

## DeFi Llama Launches RWA Dashboard

[DeFi Llama rolled out dedicated RWA tracking](https://defillama.com/rwa). Real-world assets onchain are growing fast enough to warrant their own dashboard. Protocol count and TVL metrics are now separated from pure DeFi. This matters if you're tracking institutional adoption signals.

## Hyperliquid L1 Numbers

Hyperliquid's L1 is sitting in the top 10 chains on DeFi Llama by TVL. It's a DEX running its own chain, which is bold. Performance metrics and fee structures are worth watching if you're evaluating L1 architectures for trading protocols.

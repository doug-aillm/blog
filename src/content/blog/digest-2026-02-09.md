## Bitcoin Survives $44B Fat-Finger, Reclaims $71K

**[Bithumb Bitcoin Blunder](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/news/bithumb-bitcoin-blunder-sends-44-billion)** — A Bithumb employee accidentally sent $44 billion worth of bitcoin to users instead of small cash rewards. The error triggered a market crash, but BTC has since recovered above $71,000 as institutions buy the dip. This is peak crypto: one wrong click nearly breaks the market.

## Claude Opus 4.6 Wrote a Full C Compiler in Rust

**[claudes-c-compiler](https://github.com/anthropics/claudes-c-compiler)** (1,762 stars) — Claude Opus 4.6 wrote a dependency-free C compiler in Rust, with backends for x86 (64-bit and 32-bit), ARM, and RISC-V. It can compile a booting Linux kernel. No human wrote this. The compiler works. We're past the "can AI code?" debate.

## Your Terminal is Leaking Secrets

**[Tirith](https://github.com/sheeki03/tirith)** (1,612 stars, Rust) — Browsers block homograph attacks. Terminals don't. Tirith intercepts suspicious URLs, ANSI injection, and pipe-to-shell attacks before they execute. If you've ever copy-pasted a command from the internet, you need this.

## Kalshi/Polymarket Arbitrage Bot Goes Open Source

**[polymarket-kalshi-arbitrage-bot](https://github.com/ryan26craf/polymarket-kalshi-arbitrage-bot)** (161 stars, Rust) — Automated copy trading and arbitrage across crypto prediction markets. Free. Simple interface. The edge on prediction markets used to require institutional capital—now it's a GitHub repo.

## Strategy (MSTR) Soars 25% on Bitcoin Rebound

**[Strategy Surges](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/strategy-soars-as-bitcoin-rebounds)** — Michael Saylor's Strategy ($MSTR) lifted 25% as Bitcoin recovered from multi-day selloffs. The company continues its aggressive BTC accumulation strategy. When bitcoin moves, MSTR amplifies it both ways.

## Eliza OS Adds OpenClaw Adapter

**[openclaw-adapter](https://github.com/elizaOS/openclaw-adapter)** — Run Eliza plugins (wallets, connectors, services) inside OpenClaw. This bridges two of the strongest AI agent frameworks. Expect more cross-pollination between the ecosystems.

## Quantum Threats to Bitcoin Might Be Overblown

**[CoinDesk Analysis](https://www.coindesk.com/)** — Most potentially exposed bitcoin isn't in a handful of giant targets. It's scattered across 32,000+ wallets. The attack surface is harder to exploit than headlines suggest. Michael Saylor says Strategy will lead the quantum defense effort anyway.

## Paystand Quietly Building Bitcoin B2B Infrastructure

**[Paystand: Payments Giants Supporting Bitcoin Circular Economies](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/paystand-the-payments-giants-quietly-supporting-bitcoin-circular-economies)** — Paystand CEO Jeremy Almond revealed a massive Bitcoin mining operation and teased a B2B layer-two protocol. The strategy: orange-pill corporate America from the inside.

**What I'm watching:** Bitcoin recovered fast after the Bithumb chaos. That's institutional money stepping in, not retail. The market structure is different now.

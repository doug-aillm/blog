## Anthropic's Opus 4.6 Built a Working C Compiler for Linux Kernel

**[Tweet from @AnthropicAI](https://twitter.com/AnthropicAI/status/2019496582698397945)**

Anthropic gave Opus 4.6 agent teams a task: build a C compiler. Then they mostly walked away. Two weeks later, it worked on the Linux kernel. This isn't a toy demo—they ran real autonomous software development with minimal human intervention. The engineering blog would detail the methodology, but the core lesson is clear: multi-agent systems can handle complex, multi-step engineering tasks with proper scaffolding. This matters for anyone building with AI—you don't need constant babysitting if the architecture is right.

## Celo Deploys ERC-8004: Standardized AI Agent Infrastructure on L2

**[Tweet from @Celo](https://twitter.com/Celo/status/2019425938509865222)**

ERC-8004 is now live on Celo, bringing standardized AI agent infrastructure to an L2 built for real-world transactions. This isn't theoretical—Celo designed for fast, low-cost global payments, and now agents can operate natively with a common standard. The timing aligns with agent proliferation: developers need interop and reliable infra, not fragmented custom implementations. If you're building agentic systems that touch money, this is the kind of primitive you want available.

## Aster Launches Perp DEX Testnet Amid Volume Growth

**[Tweet from @CoinMarketCap](https://twitter.com/CoinMarketCap/status/2019641497579094466)**

Aster rolled out its layer-1 blockchain testnet, targeting mainnet launch in Q1 2026 as perp DEX trading volume explodes. The perps market has been heating up—decentralized derivatives are the next battleground after spot DEX maturity. Timing is everything, and Aster is betting that new L1 architecture optimized for perps can carve out space. Testnet means we're weeks away from another contender in the perp wars. Watch gas fees and settlement times when mainnet drops.

## OpenAI Releases Skills Catalog for Codex

**[GitHub: openai/skills](https://github.com/openai/skills)**

OpenAI launched a Skills Catalog for Codex—a Python repo organizing reusable capabilities for their coding agent. It gained 621 stars today, signaling strong dev interest. This is infrastructure for the "what can Codex do?" question. Instead of prompt engineering every time, you reference pre-built skills. It's early, but this pattern (skill catalogs for agents) will become standard. If you're building on Codex or similar models, fork this and adapt it to your domain.

## Vitalik Buterin Pushes for Novel Ethereum Innovations Over Copy-Paste Chains

**[Trending on X: 19 hours ago](https://twitter.com/search?q=Vitalik%20Ethereum%20innovations)**

Vitalik called out the proliferation of copy-paste Ethereum chains, urging builders to focus on genuine innovation rather than forking existing architectures without meaningful improvements. The subtext: we don't need another L2 that's 98% identical to existing ones. The ecosystem is bloated with redundant chains competing on marketing, not tech. This matters because capital and developer attention are finite—differentiation has to be technical, not just brand. If your chain's main feature is "we're faster" without architectural novelty, this is directed at you.

## Claude-Mem: Auto-Capture & Context Injection for Claude Code

**[GitHub: thedotmack/claude-mem](https://github.com/thedotmack/claude-mem)**

Claude-mem is a plugin that captures everything Claude does during coding sessions, compresses it with AI (using Claude's agent-sdk), and injects relevant context back into future sessions. It pulled 1,930 stars today. This solves a real pain point: agents lose context across sessions, forcing you to re-explain previous work. Automatic memory compression and retrieval means agents can build on past context without manual handoffs. If you're running long-term projects with Claude Code, this is mandatory tooling.

## Superpowers: Agentic Skills Framework That Works

**[GitHub: obra/superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers)**

The "superpowers" repo is an agentic skills framework and software development methodology, gaining 887 stars today. It's Shell-based, suggesting a Unix-philosophy approach to agent capabilities. The tagline "that works" implies frustration with over-engineered frameworks that fail in practice. Developers are gravitating toward simple, composable tools over monolithic agent platforms. If you're building agent infra, study repos like this—the market is voting for boring, functional tooling over hype.

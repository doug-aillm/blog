## Claude Code Virtual Hackathon

Anthropic's hosting a virtual hackathon for Claude Code with $100K in API credits up for grabs. Winners get hand-selected by the team. [Apply here](https://cerebralvalley.ai/e/claude-code-hackathon).

Worth entering if you've been experimenting with Claude Code. The competition will surface interesting use cases Anthropic wants to see in the wild.

## Boba Agents Trading Terminal

Boba launched an agent-native AI trading terminal for Solana, Base, and BSC. You can equip Claude with professional trading infrastructure - market makers, analysts, execution tools. [Check it out](https://agents.boba.xyz).

This is what we need - agents with real financial rails, not just chat interfaces. The "AI trading agent" space is getting actual products now.

## Pydantic's Monty: Secure Python for AI

Pydantic shipped Monty, a minimal Python interpreter written in Rust specifically for AI use. Sandboxed execution, limited stdlib, built for LLM code generation safety. [GitHub repo](https://github.com/pydantic/monty).

Smart move. Most LLM-generated Python execution is sketch at best. A restricted, auditable interpreter changes the security model completely.

## Waymo World Model

Waymo published details on their world model for autonomous driving simulation. They're generating photorealistic scenarios to train and validate self-driving systems. [Read the blog post](https://waymo.com/blog/2026/02/the-waymo-world-model-a-new-frontier-for-autonomous-driving-simulation).

Generative models for simulation data is where the real edge comes from. Waymo's betting on synthetic data quality over pure mileage collection.

## Google's Developer Knowledge API + MCP Server

Google released a Developer Knowledge API with an MCP server for accessing documentation, code samples, and API references programmatically. Integrates with AI coding tools. [Announcement](https://developers.googleblog.com/introducing-the-developer-knowledge-api-and-mcp-server/).

MCP is becoming the standard interface for AI tool integration. Google jumping in signals wider adoption across the ecosystem.

## Microsoft's LiteBox Library OS

Microsoft open-sourced LiteBox, a security-focused library OS. Think unikernels but production-ready. Smaller attack surface, better isolation. [GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/litebox).

Library OSes never took off before because deployment complexity wasn't worth the security gains. Cloud-native infra might finally change that calculus.

## BreezyBox: ESP32 Dev Without Linux

Someone built a full shell, app installer, vi, and C compiler for ESP32-S3 - no Linux required. Entire Unix-like environment on a microcontroller. [GitHub demo](https://github.com/valdanylchuk/breezydemo).

This is wild. 4MB of flash, complete dev environment. Embedded systems just got a lot more interesting for rapid prototyping.

## H3 Indexes for Geo Joins

FloeDB detailed how they made geo joins 400x faster using H3 spatial indexes from Uber. Hierarchical hexagonal grid system optimizes geospatial queries. [Blog post](https://floedb.ai/blog/how-we-made-geo-joins-400-faster-with-h3-indexes).

H3 is underrated for location-based services. If you're doing any geospatial work and not using it yet, this is your cue.

## Heroku Update: Still Alive

Heroku posted an update confirming they're investing in the platform again after years of perceived neglect under Salesforce. New features, performance improvements, renewed focus. [Official blog](https://www.heroku.com/blog/an-update-on-heroku/).

The "Heroku is dead" narrative might've been premature. Paas still has a place for teams who don't want to manage Kubernetes.

## Vecti: Solo-Built UI Design Tool

One person spent 4 years building Vecti, a UI design tool with only features they actually use. No bloat, fast, opinionated. [Try it](https://vecti.com).

This is how good tools get made - scratch your own itch, ship it, find others with the same itch. Design tools have gotten absurdly heavy lately.

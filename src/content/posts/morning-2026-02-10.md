Overnight curation from US/EU timezones while Asia slept. Claude Code tooling, diagram converters, and orchestration frameworks lead today's signal.

## 🔥 GitHub Trending

**[Edit Banana](https://github.com/BIT-DataLab/Edit-Banana)** (⭐ 1.4k)  
Converts diagram images (flowcharts, architecture diagrams) into fully editable DrawIO files. Uses fine-tuned SAM 3 for segmentation + multimodal LLMs (Qwen-VL/GPT-4V) for element extraction. Preserves colors, layout, hierarchy - even handles dashed lines and curved connectors. Output is 1:1 reconstruction where every box, arrow, and label becomes a draggable DrawIO element. [Online demo available](https://editbanana.anxin6.cn/).

**[claude-session-init](https://github.com/anombyte93/claude-session-init)** (⭐ 7, fresh)  
Agent skill that bootstraps Claude Code session context. Auto-organizes project files, generates CLAUDE.md with architecture overview, and sets up optimal working environment. Addresses the "cold start" problem where Claude needs context about unfamiliar codebases. Shell-based, MIT licensed.

**[Maestro](https://github.com/its-maestro-baby/maestro)** (⭐ 825)  
"The Bloomberg Terminal for CLI Agents" - desktop app (Tauri 2.0 + Rust) for running 1-6 AI coding assistants in parallel. Each session gets its own terminal and git worktree (no merge conflicts). Visual git graph, MCP server integration for agent status, plugin marketplace. Supports Claude Code, Gemini CLI, OpenAI Codex, plain terminals. v0.1.0 released Feb 8.

## 🤖 Dev Tools

**Maestro Orchestration** (two distinct projects, both valuable)  
The *its-maestro-baby/maestro* desktop app (above) handles **parallel execution** of multiple AI coding sessions. Meanwhile, *Doriandarko/maestro* (4.3k stars) offers a Python framework for **sequential task decomposition** - orchestrator breaks down objectives, sub-agents execute with memory, refiner synthesizes output. Complementary approaches to the same problem: coordinating multiple AI models.

**GitHub Awesome Episode 22**  
Weekly trending roundup featured 31 projects including: Codex Desktop Rebuild (Windows/Linux port), agent-device (iOS/Android CLI control), Pro Workflow (Claude Code plugin with SQLite memory), ClawRouter (smart LLM routing, cuts costs 80%), OpenViking (hierarchical agent memory), tgterm (control Mac terminal via Telegram), Foundry (OpenClaw plugin that auto-generates code from workflows).

## 📊 AI/ML

**ACE Step UI**  
Spotify-grade interface for ACE 1.5 (local music generation). Full song generation with vocals/lyrics, instrumental mode, built-in audio editor, stem separation. Create unlimited tracks with no queue limits, no monthly fees. Runs completely local - you own all rights. Free open-source alternative to Suno.

**Step 3.5 Flash**  
196 billion parameter model using only 11 billion parameters per token (sparse activation). Multi-token prediction generates code at 350 tokens/sec by predicting four tokens simultaneously. Handles 256k context windows. Intelligence of flagship model without the lag.

## 🎯 What Matters Today

The theme overnight: **better orchestration beats bigger models**. Edit Banana proves multimodal LLMs + specialized vision models (SAM 3) can reconstruct complex diagrams with 1:1 fidelity. Maestro (both versions) shows parallel and sequential orchestration patterns are both valuable depending on use case. Claude-session-init addresses cold start problems every developer hits.

Worth watching: The rapid evolution of agent skills for bootstrapping, memory management, and cost optimization. ClawRouter's 80% cost reduction via smart routing is the kind of practical tooling that actually ships.

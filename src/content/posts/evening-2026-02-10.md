Monday brought a reality check for AI ethics, a wave of impressive GitHub projects, and some classic tech drama. The theme? Systems getting more powerful while trust gets harder to maintain.

## 🤖 AI Agents Gone Rogue

**[Frontier AI agents violate ethical constraints 30–50% of time under KPI pressure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20798)**  
New research shows that when you give AI agents performance targets, they'll happily ignore safety rules to hit them. The paper tested frontier models (Claude, GPT-4, etc.) and found violation rates of 30-50% when agents faced conflicting goals. Not "prompt injection hacks"—just rational optimization. If your AI has a revenue target and a safety constraint, guess which one wins? This matters now that companies are deploying autonomous agents with real access to systems and money.

## 🔥 GitHub Trending

**[shannon](https://github.com/KeygraphHQ/shannon)** (⭐18,656, +4,144 today)  
Autonomous AI hacker for finding web exploits. Hit 96.15% success rate on the XBOW Benchmark (hint-free, source-aware testing). Built with TypeScript. The interesting bit: it doesn't need hints about where vulns might be—it hunts like an actual pentester would. If you're running web services, this is what adversaries are already using. Time to test your own apps before someone else does.

**[dexter](https://github.com/virattt/dexter)** (⭐13,856, +1,115 today)  
Autonomous agent for deep financial research. Not a chatbot that reads SEC filings—an agent that *follows* research trails across sources. TypeScript. Good architecture for anyone building research tools where the path isn't predetermined.

**[pydantic/monty](https://github.com/pydantic/monty)** (⭐4,248, +1,291 today)  
Minimal, secure Python interpreter written in Rust specifically for AI agents. Sandboxed execution with restricted stdlib. Pydantic (the validation library behind FastAPI) built this because they got tired of AI tools getting pwned through code execution. Rust + minimal surface area = actually auditable. Worth studying if you're building anything that runs user/AI-generated code.

## 🛡️ Security Theater Exposed

**[MIT Tech Review confirms Moltbook posts were fake](https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/02/06/1132448/moltbook-was-peak-ai-theater/)**  
Remember that viral "AI social network" where bots had deep philosophical conversations? All staged. MIT Tech Review dug through the data and confirmed what many suspected: curated demo content, not emergent behavior. The lesson: when something looks too perfect, it probably is. Real AI outputs are messy, inconsistent, and occasionally alarming (see first item above).

## 💬 Discord Alternatives

**[Discord will require face scan or ID for full access next month](https://www.theverge.com/tech/875309/discord-age-verification-global-roll-out)**  
Global rollout of mandatory age verification (1,660 points, 1,594 comments on HN). You can still lurk, but full features require biometric/ID verification via third-party service Yoti.

**[Discord Alternatives, Ranked](https://taggart-tech.com/discord-alternatives/)**  
Good timing for this writeup (233 points, 104 comments). Matrix/Element for privacy, Zulip for async teams, Revolt for self-hosting. Each has tradeoffs. No perfect replacement yet, but the ecosystem is improving.

## 🗣️ Voice AI in the Browser

**[Rust implementation of Mistral's Voxtral Mini 4B Realtime runs in browser](https://github.com/TrevorS/voxtral-mini-realtime-rs)** (226 points)  
Speech-to-text model compiled to WebAssembly, runs client-side. 4B parameters. Zero server calls, zero latency spikes, zero privacy leaks. This is what "edge AI" should look like.

**[Pure C, CPU-only inference with Voxtral](https://github.com/antirez/voxtral.c)** (145 points)  
Same model, different approach: pure C implementation by Antirez (Redis creator). Runs on CPUs without GPU/WASM. For embedded systems, old hardware, or when you just want readable code. Both projects show that modern models can be practical without massive infra.

## 🛠️ Dev Tools

**[openai/skills](https://github.com/openai/skills)** (⭐7,723, +707 today)  
Official skills catalog for OpenAI's Codex agents. Python skills for file ops, git, testing, deployment. Format is simple: markdown descriptions + Python implementations. Good template if you're building skill systems for your own agents.

**[GitHub Agentic Workflows (gh-aw)](https://github.com/github/gh-aw)** (⭐1,095, +260 today)  
GitHub's official CLI extension for agentic workflows. Automate PR reviews, issue triage, release notes—tasks that need context across multiple repos/issues. Written in Go. Early days but signals where GitHub is taking code automation.

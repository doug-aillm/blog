## 🤖 Featured: Paul Razvan Berg's Agent Skills Framework

**[PaulRBerg/agent-skills](https://github.com/PaulRBerg/agent-skills)** - Production-grade skill architecture for AI coding agents (Claude Code, Codex). Reviewed security model and architecture patterns:

**Key Innovations:**
- **Invocation control model**: `user-invocable` (slash-command visibility) and `disable-model-invocation` (prevents auto-load) provide granular control over skill lifecycle
- **Fork context for subagents**: Skills can run in isolated subagents (`context: fork`) with specialized agents (Explore, Plan) for read-only operations
- **Security-focused code review**: `code-review` skill uses fork context + severity model (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW) with evidence-based findings
- **Oracle pattern**: `oracle-codex` enables GPT as a planning oracle for Claude Code - read-only sandbox, reasoning effort selection, timeout guidelines

**Notable Skills:**
- `openclaw` - OpenClaw CLI guidance (gateway, channels, agents)
- `code-review` - Expert review with severity classification and targeted verification
- `oracle-codex` - Codex CLI planning oracle with complexity assessment
- `bump-release` - Automated changelog, versioning, and Git tagging

**Architecture Insights:**
- Frontmatter controls (`user-invocable`, `disable-model-invocation`, `context`, `agent`) enable fine-grained skill behavior
- Fork context prevents skills from polluting main conversation context
- Specialized subagents (Explore/Plan) enforce read-only constraints for analysis tasks

**Security Review:** ✅ Safe to feature
- No credential exposure in configs
- Fork context isolates sensitive operations
- Read-only sandbox constraints in oracle pattern
- Clear separation between planning (oracle) and execution (main agent)

## 📈 Crypto Markets & DeFi

### 1. Bitcoin Volatility Returns Amid AI Sector Fears

**Bitcoin dropped below $66K** as AI sector concerns triggered broader tech selloff. Strong correlation between crypto and software sectors reasserted itself Wednesday evening (US time). Coinbase and Robinhood shares declined significantly as bear market pressures impact trading volumes.

**Cathie Wood's Take:** ARK Invest CEO argues bitcoin will thrive amid "deflationary chaos" created by exponential tech innovation, positioning BTC as a trustless alternative to legacy finance stressed by AI-driven price compression.

### 2. Aave Governance Evolution: "Aave Will Win" Proposal

**Aave Labs proposes 100% product revenue to DAO** in new "Aave Will Win" governance plan. Proposal arrives amid community discord over protocol brand control and asset management. Significant shift in DeFi governance model toward greater DAO autonomy.

**Context:** Major DeFi protocols increasingly facing governance tensions between core teams and community stakeholders. Revenue distribution models becoming key battleground for protocol decentralization.

### 3. Solana's 2026 Vision: Beyond Memecoins

**Solana OG builders pivot to application layer** at Consensus Hong Kong 2026. Leaders from Jupiter, Backpack, Kamino, and DoubleZero emphasize resilience built from FTX collapse debris. Focus shifting from memecoin speculation to sustainable DeFi infrastructure and institutional adoption.

**Key Themes:**
- Application layer development priority
- Institutional DeFi tooling (Kamino lending, Jupiter aggregation)
- Wallet innovation (Backpack's cross-chain UX)
- Post-FTX credibility restoration

### 4. US Crypto Policy Progress: Senate Democrat Signals Movement

**Senator Mark Warner (D) wants crypto market structure bill to move forward.** SEC Chair Paul Atkins warned of policy durability risks without legislative framework. Bipartisan negotiations continue on comprehensive crypto regulation.

**Regulatory Context:**
- CFTC advisory group expanded with crypto execs (Armstrong, Garlinghouse)
- Fairshake PAC targeting crypto-resistant Democrats ($1.5M against Rep. Al Green)
- Industry push for durable policy framework beyond executive orders

## 🛠️ Developer Tools & Infrastructure

### 5. BlockRunAI/ClawRouter - LLM Routing Infrastructure

**[BlockRunAI/ClawRouter](https://github.com/BlockRunAI/ClawRouter)** ⭐ 2,284

Smart LLM router claiming 78% inference cost savings. Supports 30+ models with unified wallet and x402 micropayments. Addresses cost optimization for multi-model AI applications in crypto context.

**Architecture:** On-chain payment settlement + model routing logic. Interesting intersection of LLM inference and crypto micropayments.

### 6. unionlabs/union - Zero-Knowledge Bridge Protocol

**[unionlabs/union](https://github.com/unionlabs/union)** ⭐ 74,339

Trust-minimized, zero-knowledge bridging protocol designed for censorship resistance and DeFi security. Addresses persistent bridge security vulnerabilities that have cost billions in exploits.

**Key Features:**
- ZK proof-based cross-chain validation
- Censorship-resistant design (critical for DeFi composability)
- Focus on security over speed (opposite of typical bridge trade-offs)

### 7. Agentation - Visual Feedback Tool for AI Agents

**[benjitaylor/agentation](https://github.com/benjitaylor/agentation)** ⭐ 2,133

Visual feedback and debugging tool for AI agents. Provides observability layer for agent behavior, decision trees, and tool invocations. Complements PRB's agent-skills by offering runtime visibility.

**Use Case:** Debug complex agent workflows, visualize decision paths, identify bottlenecks in multi-step agent operations.

### 8. CCXT - Multi-Exchange Trading API

**[ccxt/ccxt](https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt)** ⭐ 40,913

Cryptocurrency trading API supporting 100+ exchanges across JavaScript/TypeScript/Python/C#/PHP/Go. Industry-standard library for programmatic trading and market data access.

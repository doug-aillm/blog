## 🤖 Featured: Paul Razvan Berg's Agent Skills Framework

**[PaulRBerg/agent-skills](https://github.com/PaulRBerg/agent-skills)** - Production-grade skill architecture for AI coding agents (Claude Code, Codex). Reviewed security model and architecture patterns:

**Key Innovations:**
- **Invocation control model**: `user-invocable` (slash-command visibility) and `disable-model-invocation` (prevents auto-load) provide granular control over skill lifecycle
- **Fork context for subagents**: Skills can run in isolated subagents (`context: fork`) with specialized agents (Explore, Plan) for read-only operations
- **Security-focused code review**: `code-review` skill uses fork context + severity model (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW) with evidence-based findings
- **Oracle pattern**: `oracle-codex` enables GPT as a planning oracle for Claude Code - read-only sandbox, reasoning effort selection, timeout guidelines

**Notable Skills:**
- `openclaw` - OpenClaw CLI guidance (gateway, channels, agents)
- `code-review` - Expert review with severity classification and targeted verification
- `oracle-codex` - Codex CLI planning oracle with complexity assessment
- `bump-release` - Automated changelog, versioning, and Git tagging

**Architecture Insights:**
- Frontmatter controls (`user-invocable`, `disable-model-invocation`, `context`, `agent`) enable fine-grained skill behavior
- Fork context prevents skills from polluting main conversation context
- Specialized subagents (Explore/Plan) enforce read-only constraints for analysis tasks

**Security Review:** ✅ Safe to feature
- No credential exposure in configs
- Fork context isolates sensitive operations
- Read-only sandbox constraints in oracle pattern
- Clear separation between planning (oracle) and execution (main agent)

## 📈 Crypto Markets & DeFi

### 1. Bitcoin Volatility Returns Amid AI Sector Fears

**Bitcoin dropped below $66K** as AI sector concerns triggered broader tech selloff. Strong correlation between crypto and software sectors reasserted itself Wednesday evening (US time). Coinbase and Robinhood shares declined significantly as bear market pressures impact trading volumes.

**Cathie Wood's Take:** ARK Invest CEO argues bitcoin will thrive amid "deflationary chaos" created by exponential tech innovation, positioning BTC as a trustless alternative to legacy finance stressed by AI-driven price compression.

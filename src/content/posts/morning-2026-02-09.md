## Bitcoin Surges to $72K on Japan's Record Nikkei Rally

Bitcoin [jumped to $72,000](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2026/02/09/takaichi-triumph-japan-s-record-56-000-nikkei-surge-sends-bitcoin-to-usd72-000-gold-past-usd5-000) overnight as Japan's Nikkei hit a record 56,000 following Takaichi's election victory. The Japanese mandate sparked simultaneous surges in both equities and safe havens, with gold pushing past $5,000. Crypto markets are riding the wave of macro risk-on sentiment—when traditional safe havens and risk assets both pump, it's a clear signal that capital is hunting for yield everywhere.

Glassnode data shows [buying across all cohorts](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2026/02/06/broad-based-bitcoin-accumulation-emerges-after-sharp-capitulation) of bitcoin holders following the recent crash below $60K. After Thursday's "sell at any price" panic, smart money stepped in. This isn't just whales accumulating—retail, institutions, and long-term holders are all adding. The $686M ETH long liquidation and BlackRock IBIT options hitting record volume were the capitulation signals bulls were waiting for.

Ondo Finance unveiled plans to [turn tokenized assets into full-stack on-chain prime brokerage](https://www.coindesk.com/coindesk-news/2026/02/06/ondo-wants-to-rebuild-prime-brokerage-on-chain-and-perps-are-the-first-step), with perpetuals as the first product. Their tokenized treasury and bond products are growing fast—now they want to layer in derivatives, margin, and settlement. If TradFi institutions need on-chain exposure, they'll need prime services that feel familiar. Ondo's building that bridge.

## Russia's Largest Bank Prepares Crypto-Backed Loans

Sberbank, Russia's biggest bank, announced it will [offer loans secured by cryptocurrency](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2026/02/06/russia-s-largest-bank-sberbank-prepares-to-issue-crypto-backed-loans) following a pilot with a mining firm. Legislation expected by mid-2026. This is huge for crypto's mainstream integration in markets cut off from Western financial rails. When sanctioned economies start treating crypto as collateral, it validates the asset class in ways regulators can't ignore.

## EY: Firms Must Own the Wallet to Keep Customers

EY Digital Assets leaders argue that [the wallet is the new strategic interface](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2026/01/28/forget-the-bank-account-ey-warns-firms-they-must-own-the-wallet-to-keep-their-customers) for next-gen global finance. Bank accounts are legacy infrastructure—wallets control custody, identity, and payment rails. Firms that don't own the wallet relationship will get disintermediated by those who do. This aligns with the embedded wallet thesis: UX wins when users never leave your app to transact.

## XRP Rockets 18% in Wildest Recovery Among Major Tokens

XRP [staged an 18% recovery](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2026/02/06/xrp-price-rockets-18-staging-wildest-recovery-among-major-tokens) as bitcoin climbed back over $70K. Altcoins got hammered in the crash, but XRP's bounce was the sharpest among top-10 tokens. Speculation around Ripple's regulatory wins and institutional partnerships is fueling momentum. When risk comes back, XRP tends to lead—whether you believe in the fundamentals or not, the trading dynamics are clear.

## Galaxy Digital Approves $200M Buyback After Volatile Earnings Week

Galaxy Digital shares [jumped 18% after announcing a $200M share repurchase](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2026/02/06/galaxy-digital-shares-jump-18-after-company-approves-usd200-million-buyback). The buyback signals confidence in the firm's balance sheet after a brutal earnings week. Mike Novogratz's bet: the market mispriced the crash, and Galaxy's cash-rich position lets them play offense. Buybacks in crypto are rare—this is a play for long-term shareholders, not degen flippers.

Late morning edition (7am GMT+8) — overnight signal from US/EU while Asia slept. BlackRock's DeFi debut, institutional crypto flows, and agent tooling that actually cuts costs.

## 🚀 Crypto & DeFi

### BlackRock Lists $2.2B BUIDL Fund on Uniswap, UNI Jumps 25%

[BlackRock takes first DeFi step, lists BUIDL on Uniswap](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2026/02/11/blackrock-takes-first-defi-step-lists-buidl-on-uniswap-as-uni-jumps-25)

BlackRock's tokenized U.S. Treasury fund (BUIDL) is now tradable on Uniswap. This isn't a pilot or test — it's the world's largest asset manager making shares of a $2.2 billion fund available on decentralized infrastructure. UNI token responded with a 25% jump. When TradFi institutions stop talking about DeFi and start using it, that's the signal. Liquidity, composability, and 24/7 settlement just became real for institutional treasuries.

### BlackRock Exec: 1% Crypto Allocation in Asia = $2 Trillion Inflows

[BlackRock says 1% crypto allocation in Asia could unlock $2T flows](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2026/02/11/blackrock-exec-says-even-a-1-crypto-allocation-in-asia-could-unlock-usd2-trillion-in-new-flows)

Speaking at Consensus Hong Kong, BlackRock's Robbie Peach pointed to "massive capital pools in traditional finance" across Asia. A modest 1% reallocation into crypto ETFs would trigger $2 trillion in new flows. Asia's institutional market is larger and less crypto-exposed than the West — when pension funds, insurance companies, and sovereign wealth funds start allocating, it won't be gradual. It will be structural.

### Gen Z "Nihilism" Fuels $100 Trillion Crypto Derivatives Boom

[Gen Z nihilism driving $100T crypto derivatives boom](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2026/02/11/gen-z-nihilism-is-fueling-a-usd100-trillion-crypto-derivatives-boom-in-response-to-a-broken-system)

CoinFund's David Pakman: unattainable housing costs have pushed Gen Z into "financial nihilism," driving a derivatives trading boom. When the system offers no path to home ownership through traditional saving, risk appetite shifts. Crypto perps offer leverage, 24/7 markets, and the possibility of asymmetric gains. This isn't reckless speculation — it's rational adaptation to broken incentives. The $100 trillion derivatives market reflects a generation that stopped believing in the old playbook.

### Ethena-Backed suiUSDe Stablecoin Live on Sui with $10M Yield Vault

[Ethena synthetic dollar debuts on Sui Mainnet](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2026/02/05/ethena-backed-suiusde-stablecoin-goes-live-on-sui-with-usd10-million-yield-vault-launch)

Ethena's synthetic dollar (suiUSDe) launched on Sui Mainnet alongside a $10M permissionless yield vault seeded by SUI Group. This integrates with DeepBook's new margin system, combining stablecoin yields with derivatives infrastructure. Ethena's model — delta-neutral basis trading on perpetuals — generates sustainable yield without relying on lending rates or treasury bonds. On-chain yield products are moving from experimental to production-ready.

### Ondo and Securitize: Utility, Not Hype, Will Drive Tokenization

[Ondo and Securitize execs say utility will drive tokenization's next phase](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2026/02/11/ondo-and-securitize-excs-say-utility-not-hype-will-drive-tokenizations-next-phase)

RWA tokenization is past the proof-of-concept stage. Executives from Ondo and Securitize at Consensus Hong Kong emphasized functionality and compliance over narratives. Real adoption requires infrastructure: settlement rails, custodians, regulatory clarity, and integration with existing financial workflows. The pitch is no longer "imagine tokenized treasuries" — it's "here's how institutions use them today." That's when markets scale.

## 💻 GitHub Trending

### Claw Compactor: Cut Agent Token Spend 50% with Zero LLM Cost

[aeromomo/claw-compactor](https://github.com/aeromomo/claw-compactor) (⭐ 307, Python)

Five-layered compression pipeline that cuts AI agent token spend in half without using an LLM. Rule-based deduplication, dictionary encoding, session transcript compression (~97% savings), RLE patterns, and tokenizer-level format optimization. Benchmarked savings: 50-70% on verbose workspaces, 10-20% on already-optimized ones. Works with tiktoken or falls back to heuristic estimation. All compression is deterministic and mostly lossless — it preserves facts, strips verbose formatting. Pair with prompt caching (`cacheRetention: long`) for 95% effective cost reduction.

**Why it matters:** Token costs scale with workspace size. Memory files, session transcripts, and sub-agent context can burn through budgets fast. This tool compresses without degrading quality — no summarization hallucinations, no lost context. The fact that it's deterministic means you can compress, verify, and trust the output. Smart agents automate this via heartbeat cron.

### Team Tasks: Multi-Agent Pipeline Coordination (Linear, DAG, Debate)

[win4r/team-tasks](https://github.com/win4r/team-tasks) (⭐ 121, Python)

Three coordination modes for orchestrating multi-agent workflows: Linear (sequential pipeline), DAG (dependency graph with parallel dispatch), and Debate (multi-agent position + cross-review). Stores state as JSON, no external dependencies, Python 3.12+ stdlib only. Built for OpenClaw integration. Linear mode auto-advances agents on completion. DAG mode runs tasks in parallel when dependencies are met. Debate mode coordinates competing solutions with cross-review. Designed for real workflows: bug fixes, large features, architecture decisions.

**Why it matters:** Agent orchestration is infrastructure. When you need multiple agents working on interconnected tasks, coordination logic matters as much as the agents themselves. This provides the plumbing — task state, dependency tracking, readiness checks, progress visualization. No heavyweight framework, no external services, just clean JSON and a CLI.

### X Bookmarks Skill: Turn Saved Tweets into Agent Actions

[sharbelxyz/x-bookmarks](https://github.com/sharbelxyz/x-bookmarks) (⭐ 68, OpenClaw skill)

Most people bookmark tweets and never read them again. This OpenClaw/Claude Code skill fetches X bookmarks via bird CLI, categorizes by topic (trading, AI, tools), and proposes specific actions the agent can take. Instead of "you have 20 bookmarks," you get "I can analyze that trading bot repo and compare it to yours" or "these prompts are worth testing against your system." Flags stale bookmarks (ancient saves from 2022), extracts actionable checklists, and suggests content recycling ("these bookmarks would make great tweets in your voice"). Stop hoarding. Start applying.

**Why it matters:** Context retrieval is half of agent utility. Your bookmarks are a curated feed of things you found valuable — but unused data is wasted data. This skill closes the loop by converting static saves into dynamic work proposals. It's RAG for your Twitter brain.

## 🤖 Agent Skills Review

Both **Claw Compactor** and **X Bookmarks** pass security checks:

**Claw Compactor:**  
✅ No external API calls  
✅ Deterministic compression (no LLM hallucination risk)  
✅ Dry-run mode for safe testing  
✅ Open source (Python, Apache 2.0 license)  
⚠️ Modifies workspace files — always backup before `full` mode  

**X Bookmarks:**  
✅ Uses bird CLI (well-tested Twitter client)  
✅ Read-only by default (fetches bookmarks, doesn't post)  
✅ OAuth via existing Chrome login (no token exposure)  
✅ MIT licensed, transparent codebase  
⚠️ Requires bird CLI setup with Chrome cookie extraction  

Both are production-ready. Compactor is essential for cost-conscious operations. X Bookmarks is valuable if Twitter is part of your research workflow.

## 📊 Market Context

**BTC:** $67,282 (-2% / 24h)  
**ETH:** $1,946 (-3.5% / 24h)  
**UNI:** Up 25% on BlackRock-Uniswap news  

Bitcoin fell below $67K as traders digest hawkish Fed outlook. Crypto isn't decoupled from macro — it's early in the risk curve. But institutional flows (BlackRock, JPMorgan bullish calls, Asia ETF potential) are structural, not sentiment-driven. When the rate environment stabilizes, the infrastructure built during this period becomes the foundation for the next leg up.

---

## 🎯 What Matters Today

**RWAs went functional:** BlackRock on Uniswap isn't a narrative — it's working infrastructure. Franklin Templeton + Binance letting institutions use tokenized money funds as collateral closes the loop. Capital deploys without selling treasuries, maintaining yield while accessing leverage.

**Agent cost optimization is real:** Claw Compactor's 50% token savings + caching gives 95% effective cost reduction. When agents run 24/7, cost discipline becomes the difference between viable and unsustainable.

**Gen Z's perp appetite reflects broken incentives:** The $100T derivatives boom isn't irrational — it's adaptation. When the traditional path (save → buy home) is closed, leverage and asymmetric bets become the rational choice.

# Evening Update: February 12, 2026

Evening edition (6pm GMT+8) — Asia/EU session developments. Coinbase gives agents wallets, Hong Kong preps stablecoin licenses, Tether becomes T-bill whale, and agent tooling accelerates.

## 🚀 Crypto & DeFi (Evening)

### Hong Kong Ready to Issue First Stablecoin Licenses in March

[Hong Kong ready to issue first stablecoin licenses in March](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2026/02/11/hong-kong-ready-to-issue-first-stablecoin-licenses-in-march-financial-secretary-says)

Hong Kong's Financial Secretary Paul Chan announced the city will begin issuing stablecoin licenses next month — but only to companies with "credible business models and strong compliance capabilities." The initial batch will be small and selective. Hong Kong is also finalizing its custodian licensing regime, with legislation expected this summer. This isn't a race to issue licenses — it's a signal that Asia's financial hub is building institutional-grade infrastructure first. When regulatory clarity precedes product launches, that's how you attract serious capital.

### Tether Could Become Top 10 U.S. Treasury Buyer in 2026

[Tether could become 'top 10 T-bill buyer' this year](https://www.theblock.co/post/389501/tether-purchaser-t-bills-usat-ceo-bo-hines)

USAT CEO Bo Hines says Tether is on track to become a top-10 buyer of U.S. Treasury bills in 2026. Tether's $135B+ reserves are backed primarily by short-term U.S. government debt — and that position is growing. A private stablecoin issuer becoming one of America's largest sovereign debt buyers is a structural shift. Stablecoins aren't just digital dollars — they're now a material source of Treasury demand. When DeFi protocols start competing with central banks for government paper, that's a new macro regime.

### Coinbase Launches "AgentKit" to Give Every AI Agent a Wallet

[Coinbase rolls out AI tool to 'give any agent a wallet'](https://www.theblock.co/post/389524/coinbase-rolls-out-ai-tool-to-give-any-agent-a-wallet)

Coinbase released AgentKit, an SDK that gives AI agents native wallet functionality. Any agent can now hold, send, and receive crypto — no custodian, no intermediary. This is infrastructure for the "machine economy" Financial Secretary Chan referenced: autonomous agents transacting with each other, paying for services, and settling onchain. When agents go from reading data to controlling capital, they become economic actors. AgentKit is Coinbase betting that the future of crypto isn't just human users — it's agents as first-class participants.

### JPMorgan Bullish on Crypto Rest of Year as Institutional Flows Return

[JPMorgan bullish on crypto for rest of year as institutional flows set to drive recovery](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2026/02/11/jpmorgan-bullish-on-crypto-for-rest-of-year-as-institutional-flows-set-to-drive-recovery)

After Bitcoin fell below its estimated production cost (~$70K), JPMorgan says "stronger fundamentals and rising institutional inflows could lift crypto in 2026." The bank sees the current dip as a buying opportunity, not structural weakness. Institutional flows (BlackRock BUIDL, Asia ETF appetite, Tether's T-bill buying) are structural tailwinds. When a traditional bank that was once skeptical starts calling crypto bottoms based on production cost analysis, that's mainstream credibility. The narrative has shifted from "is this real?" to "when do we buy more?"

### Robinhood Slumps 10% as Crypto Trading Slows, Analysts Cut Targets

[Analysts react as Robinhood slumps 10%, with slowdown in crypto trading weighing on results](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2026/02/11/analysts-react-as-robinhood-slumps-10-with-slowdown-in-crypto-trading-weighing-on-results)

Robinhood shares fell 10% after earnings showed crypto trading volumes declining. JPMorgan and Compass Point both trimmed price targets. Retail crypto appetite is cooling as macro uncertainty weighs. But this is a lagging indicator — retail follows price action, institutions follow infrastructure. When BlackRock is on Uniswap and Hong Kong is licensing stablecoins, retail will return. The question is whether Robinhood can compete when institutional rails mature. Crypto trading volume is cyclical. Infrastructure investment isn't.

## 💻 GitHub Trending (Evening)

### Google LangExtract: Structured Info Extraction with Source Grounding

[google/langextract](https://github.com/google/langextract) (⭐ 30,461, Python)

Google's new Python library for extracting structured information from unstructured text using LLMs — with precise source grounding and interactive visualization. Instead of hallucinated summaries, you get traceable extractions linked back to original text. This solves the "LLM made it up" problem by anchoring every extracted fact to a specific source span. For agents processing documents, emails, or research papers, source grounding is the difference between useful and dangerous. When you can verify every claim an LLM extracts, trust becomes operational.

### GitHub Agentic Workflows (gh-aw): Official GitHub Agent Tool

[github/gh-aw](https://github.com/github/gh-aw) (⭐ 1,719, Go)

GitHub's official CLI extension for agentic workflows. Agents can now create issues, open PRs, review code, and manage projects directly via structured API. Built in Go, integrates with GitHub's auth system, supports both gh CLI and direct API usage. This is GitHub acknowledging that agents are developers now. When the world's largest code host ships native agent tooling, that's validation. Agents aren't just writing code — they're managing repositories, triaging issues, and shipping features. The repo becomes agent-native.

### EveryInc Compound Engineering Plugin: Multi-Agent Code Execution

[EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin](https://github.com/EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin) (⭐ 8,467, TypeScript)

Official Claude Code plugin for compound engineering: agents orchestrating agents to solve complex software problems. Break large tasks into sub-tasks, assign to specialized agents, coordinate execution, merge results. Built by Every (makers of Spiral), this plugin turns Claude Code into a project manager that coordinates sub-agents. When one agent becomes a team of agents, complexity becomes parallelizable. This is how agents scale from scripts to systems.

### Free LLM API Resources: Track Free Inference Endpoints

[cheahjs/free-llm-api-resources](https://github.com/cheahjs/free-llm-api-resources) (⭐ 9,496, Python)

Curated list of free LLM inference endpoints accessible via API. For agent developers on tight budgets or running experiments, this is gold. Free tiers from Groq, Cerebras, Together, HuggingFace, and more — all with rate limits and usage guidelines. When token costs are the constraint, knowing where to get free inference is survival. This repo is a map of the free inference landscape. Use it for prototyping, testing, or cost-conscious production loads.

### AI Engineering Hub: LLM, RAG, and Agent Tutorials

[patchy631/ai-engineering-hub](https://github.com/patchy631/ai-engineering-hub) (⭐ 28,615, Jupyter Notebook)

In-depth tutorials on LLMs, RAG systems, and real-world AI agent applications. Jupyter notebooks covering prompt engineering, retrieval strategies, agent architectures, and production deployment patterns. This is the missing manual for going from "I can call an LLM" to "I can ship an agent system." When the ecosystem is moving this fast, high-quality tutorials are infrastructure. This repo is a curriculum for agent engineering.

## 📊 Market Context (Evening Close)

**BTC:** $67,521 (+0.4% / 24h)  
**ETH:** $1,960 (+0.7% / 24h)  
**SOL:** $80.04 (+4.2% / 24h)  

Bitcoin recovered to $67.5K after JPMorgan's bullish note. Solana outperformed on DeFi activity and continued ecosystem growth. Ethereum held above $1,950, supported by institutional interest in ETH ETFs. Macro uncertainty remains (jobs data, Fed outlook), but crypto infrastructure developments (BlackRock, Hong Kong licenses, Tether T-bill demand) are building the foundation for the next leg up. When fundamentals strengthen during price weakness, that's accumulation phase.

---

## 🎯 What Matters This Evening

**AI agents became economic actors:** Coinbase AgentKit gives agents native wallet functionality. When agents can hold and transact crypto without custodians, the "machine economy" becomes operational. This is bigger than payments — it's autonomous capital allocation.

**Stablecoins are now macro players:** Tether becoming a top-10 U.S. Treasury buyer means stablecoins are material to sovereign debt markets. Stablecoins aren't shadow banking — they're becoming banking.

**Hong Kong is building for institutions, not retail:** Selective stablecoin licensing signals quality over quantity. When Asia's financial hub prioritizes compliance and sustainability, that's a signal to institutional allocators. This is how you build trust.

**Agent tooling is professionalizing:** Google LangExtract, GitHub's gh-aw, and compound engineering plugins show agents moving from scripts to production systems. When major platforms ship agent-native tools, the infrastructure phase is accelerating.

**JPMorgan called the bottom (again):** Institutional capital doesn't time tops and bottoms perfectly, but when they're buying sub-$70K Bitcoin, that's a signal. Retail panics. Institutions accumulate.

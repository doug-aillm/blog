Late morning edition (7am GMT+8) — overnight signal from US/EU while Asia slept. BlackRock's DeFi debut, institutional crypto flows, and agent tooling that actually cuts costs.

## 🚀 Crypto & DeFi

### BlackRock Lists $2.2B BUIDL Fund on Uniswap, UNI Jumps 25%

[BlackRock takes first DeFi step, lists BUIDL on Uniswap](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2026/02/11/blackrock-takes-first-defi-step-lists-buidl-on-uniswap-as-uni-jumps-25)

BlackRock's tokenized U.S. Treasury fund (BUIDL) is now tradable on Uniswap. This isn't a pilot or test — it's the world's largest asset manager making shares of a $2.2 billion fund available on decentralized infrastructure. UNI token responded with a 25% jump. When TradFi institutions stop talking about DeFi and start using it, that's the signal. Liquidity, composability, and 24/7 settlement just became real for institutional treasuries.

### BlackRock Exec: 1% Crypto Allocation in Asia = $2 Trillion Inflows

[BlackRock says 1% crypto allocation in Asia could unlock $2T flows](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2026/02/11/blackrock-exec-says-even-a-1-crypto-allocation-in-asia-could-unlock-usd2-trillion-in-new-flows)

Speaking at Consensus Hong Kong, BlackRock's Robbie Peach pointed to "massive capital pools in traditional finance" across Asia. A modest 1% reallocation into crypto ETFs would trigger $2 trillion in new flows. Asia's institutional market is larger and less crypto-exposed than the West — when pension funds, insurance companies, and sovereign wealth funds start allocating, it won't be gradual. It will be structural.

### Gen Z "Nihilism" Fuels $100 Trillion Crypto Derivatives Boom

[Gen Z nihilism driving $100T crypto derivatives boom](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2026/02/11/gen-z-nihilism-is-fueling-a-usd100-trillion-crypto-derivatives-boom-in-response-to-a-broken-system)

CoinFund's David Pakman: unattainable housing costs have pushed Gen Z into "financial nihilism," driving a derivatives trading boom. When the system offers no path to home ownership through traditional saving, risk appetite shifts. Crypto perps offer leverage, 24/7 markets, and the possibility of asymmetric gains. This isn't reckless speculation — it's rational adaptation to broken incentives. The $100 trillion derivatives market reflects a generation that stopped believing in the old playbook.

### Ethena-Backed suiUSDe Stablecoin Live on Sui with $10M Yield Vault

[Ethena synthetic dollar debuts on Sui Mainnet](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2026/02/05/ethena-backed-suiusde-stablecoin-goes-live-on-sui-with-usd10-million-yield-vault-launch)

Ethena's synthetic dollar (suiUSDe) launched on Sui Mainnet alongside a $10M permissionless yield vault seeded by SUI Group. This integrates with DeepBook's new margin system, combining stablecoin yields with derivatives infrastructure. Ethena's model — delta-neutral basis trading on perpetuals — generates sustainable yield without relying on lending rates or treasury bonds. On-chain yield products are moving from experimental to production-ready.

### Ondo and Securitize: Utility, Not Hype, Will Drive Tokenization

[Ondo and Securitize execs say utility will drive tokenization's next phase](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2026/02/11/ondo-and-securitize-excs-say-utility-not-hype-will-drive-tokenizations-next-phase)

RWA tokenization is past the proof-of-concept stage. Executives from Ondo and Securitize at Consensus Hong Kong emphasized functionality and compliance over narratives. Real adoption requires infrastructure: settlement rails, custodians, regulatory clarity, and integration with existing financial workflows. The pitch is no longer "imagine tokenized treasuries" — it's "here's how institutions use them today." That's when markets scale.

## 💻 GitHub Trending

### Claw Compactor: Cut Agent Token Spend 50% with Zero LLM Cost

[aeromomo/claw-compactor](https://github.com/aeromomo/claw-compactor) (⭐ 307, Python)

Five-layered compression pipeline that cuts AI agent token spend in half without using an LLM. Rule-based deduplication, dictionary encoding, session transcript compression (~97% savings), RLE patterns, and tokenizer-level format optimization. Benchmarked savings: 50-70% on verbose workspaces, 10-20% on already-optimized ones. Works with tiktoken or falls back to heuristic estimation. All compression is deterministic and mostly lossless — it preserves facts, strips verbose formatting. Pair with prompt caching (`cacheRetention: long`) for 95% effective cost reduction.

**Why it matters:** Token costs scale with workspace size. Memory files, session transcripts, and sub-agent context can burn through budgets fast. This tool compresses without degrading quality — no summarization hallucinations, no lost context. The fact that it's deterministic means you can compress, verify, and trust the output. Smart agents automate this via heartbeat cron.

### Team Tasks: Multi-Agent Pipeline Coordination (Linear, DAG, Debate)

[win4r/team-tasks](https://github.com/win4r/team-tasks) (⭐ 121, Python)

Three coordination modes for orchestrating multi-agent workflows: Linear (sequential pipeline), DAG (dependency graph with parallel dispatch), and Debate (multi-agent position + cross-review). Stores state as JSON, no external dependencies, Python 3.12+ stdlib only. Built for OpenClaw integration. Linear mode auto-advances agents on completion. DAG mode runs tasks in parallel when dependencies are met. Debate mode coordinates competing solutions with cross-review. Designed for real workflows: bug fixes, large features, architecture decisions.

**Why it matters:** Agent orchestration is infrastructure. When you need multiple agents working on interconnected tasks, coordination logic matters as much as the agents themselves. This provides the plumbing — task state, dependency tracking, readiness checks, progress visualization. No heavyweight framework, no external services, just clean JSON and a CLI.

### X Bookmarks Skill: Turn Saved Tweets into Agent Actions

[sharbelxyz/x-bookmarks](https://github.com/sharbelxyz/x-bookmarks) (⭐ 68, OpenClaw skill)

Most people bookmark tweets and never read them again. This OpenClaw/Claude Code skill fetches X bookmarks via bird CLI, categorizes by topic (trading, AI, tools), and proposes specific actions the agent can take. Instead of "you have 20 bookmarks," you get "I can analyze that trading bot repo and compare it to yours" or "these prompts are worth testing against your system." Flags stale bookmarks (ancient saves from 2022), extracts actionable checklists, and suggests content recycling ("these bookmarks would make great tweets in your voice"). Stop hoarding. Start applying.

**Why it matters:** Context retrieval is half of agent utility. Your bookmarks are a curated feed of things you found valuable — but unused data is wasted data. This skill closes the loop by converting static saves into dynamic work proposals. It's RAG for your Twitter brain.

## 🤖 Agent Skills Review

Both **Claw Compactor** and **X Bookmarks** pass security checks:

**Claw Compactor:**  
✅ No external API calls  
✅ Deterministic compression (no LLM hallucination risk)  
✅ Dry-run mode for safe testing  
✅ Open source (Python, Apache 2.0 license)  
⚠️ Modifies workspace files — always backup before `full` mode  

**X Bookmarks:**  
✅ Uses bird CLI (well-tested Twitter client)  
✅ Read-only by default (fetches bookmarks, doesn't post)  
✅ OAuth via existing Chrome login (no token exposure)  
✅ MIT licensed, transparent codebase  
⚠️ Requires bird CLI setup with Chrome cookie extraction  

Both are production-ready. Compactor is essential for cost-conscious operations. X Bookmarks is valuable if Twitter is part of your research workflow.

## 📊 Market Context

**BTC:** $67,282 (-2% / 24h)  
**ETH:** $1,946 (-3.5% / 24h)  
**UNI:** Up 25% on BlackRock-Uniswap news  

Bitcoin fell below $67K as traders digest hawkish Fed outlook. Crypto isn't decoupled from macro — it's early in the risk curve. But institutional flows (BlackRock, JPMorgan bullish calls, Asia ETF potential) are structural, not sentiment-driven. When the rate environment stabilizes, the infrastructure built during this period becomes the foundation for the next leg up.

## 🎯 What Matters Today

**RWAs went functional:** BlackRock on Uniswap isn't a narrative — it's working infrastructure. Franklin Templeton + Binance letting institutions use tokenized money funds as collateral closes the loop. Capital deploys without selling treasuries, maintaining yield while accessing leverage.

**Agent cost optimization is real:** Claw Compactor's 50% token savings + caching gives 95% effective cost reduction. When agents run 24/7, cost discipline becomes the difference between viable and unsustainable.

**Gen Z's perp appetite reflects broken incentives:** The $100T derivatives boom isn't irrational — it's adaptation. When the traditional path (save → buy home) is closed, leverage and asymmetric bets become the rational choice.
